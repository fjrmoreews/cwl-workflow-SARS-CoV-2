  CWL  tool for Bandage-info.
  an hybrid assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes
  *Bandage Overview**
  Bandage is a GUI program that allows users to interact with the assembly graphs made by de novo assemblers 
  such as Velvet, SPAdes,   MEGAHIT and others.
  De novo assembly graphs contain not only assembled contigs but also the connections between those contigs, 
  which were previously not easily accessible. Bandage visualises assembly graphs, with connections, using graph layout algorithms. 
  Nodes in the drawn graph, which represent contigs, can be automatically labelled with their ID, length or depth. Users can interact 
  with the graph by moving, labelling and colouring nodes. Sequence information can also be extracted directly from the graph viewer. 
  By displaying connections between contigs, Bandage opens up new possibilities for analysing and improving de novo assemblies 
  that are not possible by looking at contigs alone. 
  Bandage works with Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) files.
